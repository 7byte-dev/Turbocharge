        <h4>About Turbocharge</h4>
        <p class="share-tech-mono-regular">I was a curious little 13-year-old, fresh out of a few C courses. I was
            trying to make little programs with
            C, but... the segfaults, weird compiler warnings, it was all a headache. "ALL OF THESE FRICKING OPERATING
            SYSTEMS ARE BROKEN", I thought to myself. Then, something sparked in my brain. "What if I make an operating
            system for myself?", I thought. Then, that little spark caused a wildfire which I like to call, Turbocharge
            Operating System.<br></p>
        <p class="share-tech-mono-regular">Turbocharge OS, or TCOS for short, is a rage-driven, Terry Davis-inspired,
            x86 operating system. TCOS is yet
            in it's early development stages, and it's still a kernel-only operating system for now. I have successfully
            implemented a simple one-command-only shell and a very basic memory management for TCOS. I am planning on
            implementing much more cool features and improving the current ones.</p>

        <h4>Why x86?</h4>
        <p class="share-tech-mono-regular">I am making this operating system with a no-nonsense mindset. No useless
            virtual memory, because why should you not know what physical address do you have? No interrupts, the OS
            should be the overseeing god, not devices going "notice me senpai". And, as such, I think that we need no
            further than 4GB of memory. Because I believe, with just the right amount of optimizations and sacrifices,
            anything is possible&mdash;even cyberpunk on integrated graphics! So yeah, if you can't run Windows 11 on
            2GB of RAM, it's microsoft's fault making it bloated, not yours for having less ram.</p>

        <h4>Turbocharge Evolution</h4>
        <p class="share-tech-mono-regular">Turbocharge is still in it's early evolutionary stages, so there might not be
            much to look into. BUT, that doesn't mean there aren't any history pieces to look into.</p>
        <ul class="share-tech-mono-regular">
            <li><strong>Late 2023 - The Humble Beginnings:</strong> This is where it all started. It was a simple
                youtube search query of "how to make and os". Not much happened.</li>
            <li><strong>Early-Mid 2024 - The Baby Steps:</strong> Turbocharge started taking it's first steps.
                Bootloader was being built. Not much happened because of the motivational spikes ands falls</li>
            <li><strong>Late 2024 - The Revolution:</strong> Started kernel development, Turbocharge got accidentally
                deleted, restarted.</li>
            <li><strong>2025 (current stage) - The Now:</strong> a LOT of things happened, which are just too much to
                list here.</li>
